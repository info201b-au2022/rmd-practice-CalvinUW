## Covid Report
To track the state of the Covid-19 pandemic we decided to analyze the newst national-level for case and death counts. Currently, the total number of Covid-19 cases that have happened in the US is `r get_total_cases()`, while the total number of Covid-19 caused deaths in the US is `r get_total_deaths()`.
